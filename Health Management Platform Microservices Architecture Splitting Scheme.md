# 🏗️ Health Management Platform Microservices Architecture Splitting Scheme (Full Version)

## 📋 Scheme Overview

Based on the project’s 20 core modules and a target of 50 million users, the monolithic Odoo application is split into **10 independent microservice instances**, unified through an API gateway and communicating via an event-driven architecture.

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Domain-Driven**: Each service corresponds to a clear business capability.  
2. **Loose Coupling, High Cohesion**: Services communicate via APIs/events, avoiding direct ORM dependencies.  
3. **Independent Scalability**: Services can scale individually according to business load.  
4. **Tech Heterogeneity**: Supports different tech stacks, ideal for AI, live streaming, and other specialized needs.

## 🔄 Inter-service Communication Architecture

### 1. Synchronous API Calls (Direct Service Invocation)
```python
# Internal service calls via API gateway
class TradeService:
    def create_order(self, order_data):
        # 1. Verify user identity (sync call to auth-service)
        auth_response = api_gateway.call(
            'auth-service', f'/users/{order_data["user_id"]}/verify')
        
        # 2. Check user health data (sync call to user-service)
        health_response = api_gateway.call(
            'user-service', f'/users/{order_data["user_id"]}/health-data')
        
        # 3. Create order
        order = self._create_order(order_data)
        
        # 4. Publish async event
        event_bus.publish('order_created', order.to_dict())
        
        return order
```

### 2. Asynchronous Event-Driven (Decoupled Workflows)
```python
# Example of event publishing
class OrderService:
    def complete_service(self, order_id):
        order = self.get_order(order_id)
        order.mark_completed()
        
        # Publish service completed event for parallel handling
        event_bus.publish('service_completed', {
            'order_id': order_id,
            'user_id': order.user_id,
            'health_worker_id': order.health_worker_id,
            'completion_time': datetime.now(),
            'rating': order.rating
        })

# Example of event consumption by multiple handlers
@event_bus.subscribe('service_completed')
class FinanceServiceHandler:
    def handle_service_completed(self, event):
        # Handle payment settlement
        self.process_settlement(event)

@event_bus.subscribe('service_completed')        
class DynamicServiceHandler:
    def handle_service_completed(self, event):
        # Generate activity feed entry
        self.generate_activity(event)

@event_bus.subscribe('service_completed')
class OpsServiceHandler:
    def handle_service_completed(self, event):
        # Update health coach rating
        self.update_rating(event)
```

## 🚀 Deployment and Scaling Strategy

### Stage 1: Initial (Users < 1 million)
```yaml
Deployment Architecture:
  - 2 physical servers/cloud hosts
  - 2 instances per service (20 containers total)
  - PostgreSQL master-slave replication
  - Single-node Redis cache

Resource Allocation:
  - auth-service: 2 CPU / 4 GB × 2 instances
  - user-service: 2 CPU / 4 GB × 2 instances
  - trade-service: 4 CPU / 8 GB × 2 instances (core business)
  - Other services: 2 CPU / 4 GB × 1 instance each
```

### Stage 2: Growth (Users 1 million–20 million)
```yaml
Deployment Architecture:
  - Kubernetes cluster (10–20 nodes)
  - Database sharding
  - Redis cluster
  - Message queue cluster

Elastic Scaling:
  - dynamic-service: 10–20 instances (read-intensive)
  - trade-service: 5–10 instances (peak trading)
  - auth-service: 4–8 instances (authentication load)
  - ai-service: GPU nodes auto-scale
```

### Stage 3: At Scale (Users 20 million+)
```yaml
Deployment Architecture:
  - Multi-region deployment
  - Service mesh (Istio)
  - Big data platform
  - Dedicated GPU cluster for AI

Advanced Features:
  - Intelligent traffic routing
  - Automatic failover
  - End-to-end monitoring
  - Automated operations
```

## ⚠️ Key Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Distributed Transaction Challenge
```python
# Using Saga pattern + compensation transactions
class OrderCreationSaga:
    def execute(self, order_data):
        steps = [
            {'service': 'auth', 'action': 'verify_user', 'compensate': 'lock_user'},
            {'service': 'trade', 'action': 'create_order', 'compensate': 'cancel_order'},
            {'service': 'finance', 'action': 'reserve_payment', 'compensate': 'release_payment'}
        ]
        
        for step in steps:
            try:
                result = self.call_service(step['service'], step['action'])
                self.completed_steps.append(step)
            except Exception as e:
                self.compensate()  # Perform compensation actions
                raise e
```

### 2. Data Consistency Assurance
```python
# Eventual consistency + reconciliation mechanism
class DataReconciliation:
    def daily_reconciliation(self):
        # Daily reconciliation to repair inconsistencies
        trade_orders = trade_service.get_daily_orders()
        finance_payments = finance_service.get_daily_payments()
        
        discrepancies = self.find_discrepancies(trade_orders, finance_payments)
        self.repair_discrepancies(discrepancies)
```

### 3. Service Discovery and Load Balancing
```yaml
# Kubernetes Service configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: trade-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: trade-service
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8000
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: trade-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: trade-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: trade-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: trade-service
        image: trade-service:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```
